## Hi there 👋 I'm Tingting!

🎓 Currently exploring the fields of perception learning and robots to develop innovative and multimodal robotics solutions. I code in Python, C++, JavaScript, and C# and constantly learn new technologies to expand my skills. 

🤔 I’m particularly interested in:
  
      🤖 Robotics
  
      📸 Computer Vision
  
      🧠 Speech recognition
  
      🛠️ Reinforcement learning
  
      💻 Artificial Intelligence
  
📚 Currently learning more about reinforcement learning from human feedback to develop robot navigation algorithms.

🚀 Future goal: To develop a multimodal interactive and useful robot to help people live happier and healthier lives.

🔗 Let's connect, collaborate, and build something meaningful together!
