## Hi there 👋 I'm Tingting!

🎓 Currently exploring the fields of speech recognition, computer vision, machine learning, and augmented reality to develop innovative social robotics solutions. I code in Python, JavaScript, and C# and constantly learn new technologies to expand my skills. 

🤔 I’m particularly interested in:
  
      🤖 Human-Robot Interaction
  
      📸 Computer Vision
  
      🧠 Speech recognition
  
      🛠️ Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality interactive programming
  
      💻 Artificial Intelligence
  
📚 Currently learning about deep learning and computer vision to better understand the capabilities of machine learning models.

🚀 Future goal: To develop multimodal interactive robot programming and create a robot to help people live happier and healthier lives.

🔗 Let's connect, collaborate, and build something meaningful together!
